# The Day

Sorry wasn't working much for OSCP recently, but i have started again. So actually i got break from my MMA training so i guess next 25 days i would use that time for OSCP instead. Okay so enough chit-chat let's get back to work.

<br>
## Private IPs
So IPs in abstract is kinda your address on the internet and it is in the form of `xx.xx.xx.xx` where 'xx' could be any number between 0-255. Since the number of devices connected to the internet is very large and the number of IP is less so we have two types of IPs:
- Public IPs: The ip address which is visible to machines on internet (machines outside of internal network).
- Private IPs: The ip address which is visible to machines in internal network.

So for internal network following ip ranges are reserved.

1. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
2. 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
3. 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
{% endhighlight %}

## Shodan CLI
So shodan is basically like a search engine which kinda caches the info about open ports etc on any machine and grabs banner in the http responses to gain info about the services. It is a very good tool to use while doing OSINT. So while doing red-teaming for any organisation you can easily collect a lot of info passively. So either you could go to the web interface of <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">Shodan</a> (no need to create account for this)  or you could utilize it's apis or you could use CLI tool.

To use the CLI tool (or <a href="https://cli.shodan.io/">Install Shodan CLI</a>):
{% highlight plaintext %}
1. Create your user account on Shodan.
2. install latest python version.
3. easy_install shodan
4. shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
	- You can get YOUR_API_KEY in your Account overview section in shodan account.
{% endhighlight %}

So i wrote down this bash script to open a file containing a list of IPs and get all info about it
{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

file=$1
echo "File path"
echo $file

while IPS= read -r line
do
    echo "Scanning the ip: " $line
    shodan host $line
done < "$file"
{% endhighlight %}

You could run it like
{% highlight bash %}
- Save the file as Shodan_Hosts.sh
- chmod u+x Shodan_Hosts.sh
- Create a file 'IPs' which will contain a list of all the ip for which you need info
- ./Shodan_Hosts.sh IPs | tee Shodan_Hosts_Report.txt
{% endhighlight %}
