# Motivation

I am a Security Engineer right now and i decided to go for ```OSCP``` certification. I tried once before like some months ago, but laziness took over :P . So some days ago i decided to try again and to not give up this time and this wonderful idea came to my mind. So when i was preparing for OSCP earlier then i used to gather resources after looking into blogs of other people who did it and one thing always made me wonder, they all said this quote ```Try Harder```. So i thought why not document all this journey of mine and maybe this will help someone to gain confidence that they can do it and it's not that hard after all.

<br>
# Rules

So these are some of the rules that i have set up for myself.
- I have to complete it in 4 months
    - First month will be practicing on resources already available on internet.
    - After first month i will take subscription for 3 months.
- I will try to never reveal the VM or the specific machine i am trying to solve so that nobody could use my blogs to just solve VMs in minutes.
- I will try to keep it as technical as i can.
- I will max give 20-25 mins for writing the blog and will keep it small.
- I am doing this thing for gaining knowledge and not just for certification sake, so i will let myself deviate from actual exam material sometimes.
- I will write all these blogs in vi only.

<br>
# Current Status

So the summary of my current technical knowledge in security is
- I have an experience of about 1.3 yrs of being a software developer.
- I am an Security Engineer for about 8 months now.
- I have learnt about OWASP top 10 although not so good.
- I have done some 15 VMs totally from vulnhubs etc.
- I have some experience with automation of the stuffs too.
- And at last i have done some challenges on sites like RootMe, overthewire etc.

# The Day

<br>
## A little about Ruby and Gems.
Okay so from yesterday i was trying to set up this ```Jekyll``` blog and it took a lot of time. And since this Jekyll uses Ruby, Gems. so got to learn a little about these. 
{% highlight ruby %}
1. rvm install ruby
2. rvm install ruby-2.1.3 (To install specific version)
3. rvm uninstall ruby
4. gem install <some_gem>
5. gem use some_gem-2.1.3 (To use specific version of a gem)
6. gem --default use some_gem-2.1.3 (To make some version default)
7. bundle install (When you have Gemfile {all the gem dependencies required for the project} and want to install all the gem dependencies)
8. bundle update (usually when some error occurs while bundle install)
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
## Git Rebase
Then while setting this up i was having problem with ```git``` too so went through some 4-5 blogs of git too and along with some basic concepts i got to understand two interesting concepts. So the first interesting thing was using how to use ```git rebase```. 

So rebasing is used for let's say you are developing a feature and it will take some 7 days for your code to complete and in between multiple other developers are working on the same codebase. Then usually you will keep updating master branch to keep your code updated and avoid merge conflicts. And what this will do is mess up your commit history with other developers commits and merge commits in between your commit. So to avoid that you can use ```git rebase``` which will basically group all other developers commit in a line and will produce no extra merge commits and place all your commits after it.

Some basic git commands
{% highlight ruby %}
1. git add <filename>
2. git commit -m "some message"
3. git push -u origin <branch-name>
4. git branch
5. git checkout <branch-name>
6. git commit --amend -m “New commit message”
7. To Rebase
    - git checkout feature_branch
    - git rebase master
    - In case some merge conflict happens, resolve the conflict
        - git add file
	- git rebase --continue
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
## Commit on github masquerading as someone else.
The next cool thing i learnt about is how to masquerade in commit history. So basically the concept is when you install git then git takes your email id and username and uses that whenever it is sending an commit. And basically you could change these config using ```git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"```. So i tried this with setting a random email id (and i guess it has to be a valid github user email id) and commited a change and pushed it and here is the result.

![Multiple commits done by same user, being shown as done by different user.][git_commit_masquerading]

{% highlight ruby %}
To set your global username/email configuration
1. git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
2. git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

To set repository-specific username/email configuration
1. git config user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
2. git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

To verify settings
1. cat .git/config
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
## A little about OSINT
So yesterday i went to Null Humla session here. And this awesome speaker Bharat taught about ```OSINT```. Although i couldn't gather everything he talked about (due to internet connection problem), but he did provide the notes and a link to the CTF he made so i will be going through those all materials again sometime in this week and post the interesting stuffs. For now i do remember some interesting stuff to read upon will be reading about ```DNS``` records and using ```dig```. 
{% highlight ruby %}
1. dig some-site.com
2. dig @nameserver some-site.com
    - the dns server is called nameserver.
3. dig TXT some-site.com
    - there are various types of records and TXT is one of them.
