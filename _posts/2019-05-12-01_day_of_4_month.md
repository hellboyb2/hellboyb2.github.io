# The Day

Had a long day at office and after that went to dinner with the colleagues so couldn't do much. Although i read a few things about OSINT (DNS Enumeration etc.), but i haven't practiced it yet so won't post about that today. Also for about 1.5 months i will be focussing on OSINT alot due to overlapping need of office task and my own training.

<br>
## Httrack
Okay this tool is preinstalled in kali linux and this tool is basically used to clone a site. The cloned site data could be used for phishing etc. And also just remember that if you clone the site using this then there will be no dynamic component to the site (it will become static). 
So what i did is just hosted one of my exiting php site on localhost and cloned that using this tool and then hosted the cloned site using php.

{% highlight ruby %}
1. httrack http://localhost:8000 -O <Output-directory>
2. To rehost: Go to the <Output-directory> folder
    * php -S localhost:8001
{% endhighlight %}

`Note: Please do not clone any site where you do not have permission.`

<br>
## sslyze
Okay this tool could be easily installed on mac using ```brew install sslyze```. This tool is used for enumerating ciphers and ssl versions supported by a host. Also this tool could be used to check some well known attacks on ssl on hosts.

{% highlight ruby %}
1. sslyze https://<some-domain>
2. brew install sslyze
{% endhighlight %}
